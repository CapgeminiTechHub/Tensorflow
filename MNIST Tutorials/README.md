# MNIST Tutorials


## mnist_tutorial.py 
A basic tutorial that builds a simple softmax network for classifying the MNIST dataset. Also includes suggested improvements that can be made. Some of these alterations may not immediately improve the accuracy of the model, but will need you to experiment with them to leverage their full potential.

This tutorial has been broken down into four parts.

### mnist_tutorial_data.py 
The first part of the main tutorial, loading the MNISt dataset and visualising it.
### mnist_tutorial_model.py
The second part of the main tutorial, building the model.
### mnist_tutorial_training.py
The third part of the main tutorial, training the model.
### mnist_tutorial_visualisation.py 
Visualises the learning of the simple softmax network.
